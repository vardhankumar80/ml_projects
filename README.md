# Machine Learning Projects

Objectives

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in churn behavior.

- Handle imbalanced dataset using oversampling techniques like SMOTE.

- Train multiple models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost).

- Evaluate models with metrics beyond accuracy: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

- Identify and handle data leakages
